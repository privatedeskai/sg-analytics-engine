# Gonka OpenAI TypeScript Client

A TypeScript client for integrating with the Gonka network and OpenAI API.

## Installation

```bash
npm install gonka-openai
```

## Usage

There are two ways to use this library:

### Option 1: Using the GonkaOpenAI wrapper (recommended)

```typescript
import { resolveEndpoints, GonkaOpenAI } from 'gonka-openai';

const endpoints = await resolveEndpoints({ sourceUrl: 'https://gonka.example.com' });
// Private key can be provided directly or through environment variable GONKA_PRIVATE_KEY
const client = new GonkaOpenAI({ 
  gonkaPrivateKey: '0x1234...', // ECDSA private key for signing requests
  endpoints
});

// Use exactly like the original OpenAI client
const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'Qwen/QwQ-32B',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello!' }],
});
```

### Option 2: Using the original OpenAI client with a custom fetch function

```typescript
import OpenAI from 'openai';
import { gonkaBaseURL, gonkaFetch, resolveAndSelectEndpoint } from 'gonka-openai';

const {endpoints, selected} = await resolveAndSelectEndpoint({ sourceUrl: 'https://gonka.example.com' });

// Create a custom fetch function for Gonka with your private key
const fetch = gonkaFetch({
  gonkaPrivateKey: '0x1234...', // Your private key
  selectedEndpoint: selected
});

// Create an OpenAI client with the custom fetch function
const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: 'mock-api-key', // OpenAI requires any key
  baseURL: selected.url, // Use Gonka network endpoints 
  fetch: fetch // Use the custom fetch function that signs requests
});

// Use normally - all requests will be dynamically signed and routed through Gonka
const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'Qwen/QwQ-32B',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello!' }],
});
```

This approach provides the same dynamic request signing as Option 1, but gives you more direct control over the OpenAI client configuration.

## Environment Variables

Instead of passing configuration directly, you can use environment variables:

- `GONKA_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your ECDSA private key for signing requests
- `GONKA_SOURCE_URL`: (Optional) Participants discovery URL. Note: used by the resolver helpers (`resolveEndpoints`, `resolveAndSelectEndpoint`); the class constructor does not resolve it automatically.
- `GONKA_VERIFY_PROOF`: (Optional) Set to `1` to enable ICS23 proof verification during endpoint discovery. If unset, verification is skipped by default.
- `GONKA_ENDPOINTS`: (Optional) Comma-separated list of Gonka network endpoints with their transfer addresses. Each endpoint is specified as `url;transferAddress` (semicolon-separated pair).
- `GONKA_ADDRESS`: (Optional) Override the derived gonka address

Example with environment variables:

```typescript
// Set in your environment:
// GONKA_PRIVATE_KEY=0x1234...
// GONKA_SOURCE_URL=https://gonka1.example.com

import { GonkaOpenAI, resolveEndpoints } from 'gonka-openai';

// Resolve endpoints from SourceUrl, then construct the client
const endpoints = await resolveEndpoints({});
const client = new GonkaOpenAI({ apiKey: 'mock-api-key', endpoints });

// Use normally
const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'Qwen/QwQ-32B',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello!' }],
});
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Endpoint Selection

You can provide a custom endpoint selection strategy:

```typescript
import { GonkaOpenAI } from 'gonka-openai';

const endpoints = await resolveEndpoints({ sourceUrl: 'https://gonka.example.com' });

const client = new GonkaOpenAI({
  apiKey: 'mock-api-key',
  gonkaPrivateKey: '0x1234...',
  endpoints: [
    {
      url: 'https://gonka1.example.com/v1',
      transferAddress: 'gonka1a...'
    },
    {
      url: 'https://gonka2.example.com/v1',
      transferAddress: 'gonka1b...'
    },
  ],
  endpointSelectionStrategy: (endpoints) => {
    // Custom selection logic
    // Each endpoint has url and transferAddress properties
    console.log(`Selecting from ${endpoints.length} endpoints`);
    return endpoints[0]; // Always use the first endpoint
  }
});
```

## TransferAddress Requirement

Each endpoint in the Gonka network requires a **TransferAddress**, which is the gonka address of the endpoint provider. This address is essential for the request signing process and cannot be omitted.

- The TransferAddress is used as part of the signature payload, along with the request body and a timestamp
- It identifies the provider of the endpoint you're connecting to
- Without a valid TransferAddress, requests will fail

When specifying endpoints, always include both the URL and the TransferAddress:

```typescript
const endpoints = [
  {
    url: 'https://gonka1.example.com/v1',
    transferAddress: 'gonka1...' // gonka address of the endpoint provider
  }
];
```

## How It Works

1. **Custom Fetch Implementation**: The library intercepts all outgoing API requests by providing a custom `fetch` implementation to the OpenAI client
2. **Request Body Signing**: For each request, the library:
   - Extracts the request body
   - Generates a unique timestamp in nanoseconds
   - Concatenates the request body, timestamp, and TransferAddress
   - Signs the combined data with your private key using ECDSA
   - Adds the signature to the `Authorization` header
   - Adds the timestamp to the `X-Timestamp` header
3. **Address Generation**: Your gonka address (derived from your private key) is added to the `X-Requester-Address` header
4. **Endpoint Selection**: Requests are routed to the Gonka network using a randomly selected endpoint

## Cryptographic Implementation

The library implements:

1. **ECDSA Signatures**: Using Secp256k1 curve to sign request bodies with the private key
2. **Gonka Address Generation**: Deriving gonka-compatible addresses from private keys
3. **Dynamic Request Signing**: Using a custom fetch implementation to intercept and sign each request before it's sent

## Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gonka-openai.git
cd gonka-openai/typescript
npm install
npm run build
```

## Testing

To run a simple test that demonstrates the client:

```bash
node test.mjs
